## DAD Quiz Application 

DAD Quiz Application is a web application that allows users to answer quiz questions on a selected number of topics. The topics are fetched from an existing API, which also provides random questions related to a selected topic. Additionally, the application tracks the number of correctly answered questions and organizes them to be shown in a statictics page. The main page and the statistics page can be freely navigated through the top bar. 

When entering the application, the main page shows the list of selectable topics and a practice option. Choosing any of the topics leads the user to a page with a multiple-choice question. Once the user selects the correct answer, they can navigate to a new question of the same topic. If the practice option is selected, the user is provided with questions from the topic for which the user has the least correct answers.
